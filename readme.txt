Switch between the backends of your WPMU blogs with one click 

== Description ==

Switch between the backends of your WPMU blogs with just one click. This is probably only useful if you don't have too many blogs and use all of them yourself. The switch links will be added to your super admin menu.

With the release of WordPress 3.0 I merged several WordPress installs into a single network-enabled WordPress 3.0 install. As I post on all of them I wanted the ability to switch quickly between the backends. This plugin makes that possible

By the way, I use the Ozh admin menu plugin. You might need two clicks to switch if you don't.

= My plugins =

[MU fast backend switch](http://www.nkuttler.de/2010/06/07/wpmu-switch-backend/): Switch between your MU blog backends with one click

[Visitor Movies for WordPress](http://www.nkuttler.de/2010/05/21/record-movies-of-visitors/): Did you ever want to know what your visitors are really doing on your site? Watch them!

[Better tag cloud](http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/nktagcloud/): I was pretty unhappy with the default WordPress tag cloud widget. This one is more powerful and offers a list HTML markup that is consistent with most other widgets.

[Theme switch](http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/nkthemeswitch/): I like to tweak my main theme that I use on a variety of blogs. If you have ever done this you know how annoying it can be to break things for visitors of your blog. This plugin allows you to use a different theme than the one used for your visitors when you are logged in.

[Zero Conf Mail](http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/zero-conf-mail/): Simple mail contact form, the way I like it. No ajax, no bloat. No configuration necessary, but possible.

[Custom avatars for comments](http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/custom-avatars-for-comments/): Add a personal touch: Your visitors will be able to choose from the avatars you upload to your website for each and every comment they make.

[Move WordPress comments](http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/nkmovecomments/): This plugin adds a small form to every comment on your blog. The form is only added for admins and allows you to [move comments](http://www.nkuttler.de/nkmovecomments/) to a different post/page and to fix comment threading.

[Delete Pending Comments](http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/delete-pending-comments): This is a plugin that lets you delete all pending comments at once. Useful for spam victims.

[Snow and more](http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/nksnow/): This one lets you see snowflakes, leaves, raindrops, balloons or custom images fall down or float upwards on your blog.

[Fireworks](http://www.nkuttler.de/wordpress/nkfireworks/): The name says it all, see fireworks on your blog!

[Rhyming widget](http://www.rhymebox.de/blog/rhymebox-widget/): I wrote a little online [rhyming dictionary](http://www.rhymebox.com/). This is a widget to search it directly from one of your sidebars.
